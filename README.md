# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I developed to showcase my skills and projects. Built with React and Next.js, it features a modern, responsive design created with Tailwind CSS. The design was meticulously crafted using Figma. The website highlights my expertise in front-end and full-stack development, with detailed descriptions of my projects and a section on my technical skills and tools.
